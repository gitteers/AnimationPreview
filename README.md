# AnimationPreview
 
## Introduction

AnimationPreview lets you animate models inside the Unity Editor.

For one of my projects I wanted to see which models fit into the scene and which animations to use for dynamic and static assets. There are lots of models and animations to choose from on the Unity Asset Store. So in order to save time and to get a quick preview about how a model looks and animates in a scene I quickly coded this Editor Extension. I thought I'd share in case you guys have use for it.

## Installation

Using Package Manager:

https://github.com/Roland09/AnimationPreview.git?path=/Assets/AnimationPreview

## Usage

* create a gameobject via menu or drag the AnimationPreview.cs script on a new gameobject
* drag a gameobject with an animator over the Animator slot
* hit the Play button in the inspector and use the controls to animate the gameobject inside the Unity Editor
